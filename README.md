What you should do first is to click the `fork` button on this repo on Github.

## Common commands:

* `git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/Code-LTHGit2016.git` to clone this entire repo (your fork) into a directory on your computer.
* `git status` to check how badly things are going. If you don't know what command to run, run this one.
* `git add .` (note the period) adds all changed files to the "index", making them ready to be committed.
* `git commit -m "Insert commit message here (including quotes)"` creates a commit with the currently `add`ed files.
* `escape:q!` if you're stuck in vim and don't know how to get out.
* `git push` uploads your changes to the default remote (repo) (see `git remote --help` for more info on that).
* `git pull` to download changes in the repo.
* `git stash` then `git pull` then `git stash pop` if you're in the middle of changing something but still want to pull.
* `git diff` to show line changes you've made.
